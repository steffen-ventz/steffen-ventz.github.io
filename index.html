<h2> About me </h2>

<p>
   I am a reserach scientist at the Department of Data Sciences at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute 
   and the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. School of Public Health.
   I am affiliated with the Cencer for Regulatory Sciences at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 
   <br>
   <br>

   Before joining DFCI and Harvard University, I spent a couple of years as an Assistant Professor at the University of Rhode Island, 
   where I was also affiliated with the Department of Computer Science and Statistics. 
   Prior to URI, I was a PostDoctoral Fellow at at the Harvard T.H. School of Public Health.
   I completed my PhD in Statistics from Bocconi University in Milan, Italy, under the supervision of Pietro Muliere. 
   <br>
   <br>   


   My research interests are mainly in response-adaptive clinical trials, statistical computation,
   Bayesian decision theory, Bayesian analyses and lately reinfored learning and causal inference.
   Iâ€™ve done  work on information theory, Bayesian dose finding methods, platform and basket trials,
   statistical inference under adaptive sampling designs, causal inference and computational biology. 
   My recent research interests focuse on multiple testing, deep learning and data fusion.  
   Recent collaborative projects have involved applications in cancer and infectious disease.
   See my  <a href="research.html"> Papers</a>  page for more details.
